<p><strong>Practically all LeetCode BST exercises require recursion</strong>, which will be covered later in the course in the following sections:</p><p><br></p><ol><li><p><strong>Recursive Binary Search Trees</strong>: Dive deep into how recursion powers the core operations in BSTs, such as searching, insertion, and deletion. We'll start with the basics and gradually move to more complex applications.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tree Traversal</strong>: Learn the various ways to navigate through a tree, a skill essential for understanding and manipulating BSTs. This section will cover:</p><ul><li><p>Breadth-First Search (BFS)</p></li><li><p>Depth First Search (DFS) in three variants:</p><ul><li><p>Pre-Order</p></li><li><p>In-Order</p></li><li><p>Post-Order</p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ol><p><br><strong>LeetCode / Interview Questions We Will Cover:</strong></p><p>To ensure you're well-prepared for technical interviews, we'll tackle some of the most common BST interview questions, including:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Deleting a Node from a BST</strong>: Understand the strategies to remove a node while maintaining the BST properties.</p></li><li><p><strong>Converting a Sorted Array to a Balanced BST</strong>: Learn how to transform a sorted array into a balanced BST to ensure efficient operations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inverting a BST</strong>: Explore the concept of flipping a BST to mirror its structure.</p></li><li><p><strong>Validating a BST</strong>: Discover how to check if a binary tree satisfies BST conditions, an essential problem-solving skill.</p></li></ul><p>By the end of these sections, you'll have a solid foundation in both recursion and BSTs.</p>
